Pudding is a type of food that can be either a dessert or a savory dish.
The word pudding is believed to come from the French boudin, originally
from the Latin botellus, meaning "small sausage", referring to encased
meats used in medieval European puddings. The modern usage of the word
pudding to denote primarily desserts has evolved over time from the almost
exclusive use of the term to describe savory dishes, specifically those
created using a process similar to sausages where meat and other
ingredients in a mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled
to set the contents. Black pudding, Yorkshire pudding, and haggis survive
from this tradition.

In the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries, the word
pudding can be used to describe both sweet and savory dishes. Unless
qualified, however, the term in everyday usage typically denotes a
dessert; in the United Kingdom, pudding is used as a synonym for a dessert
course. Dessert puddings are rich, fairly homogeneous starch- or
dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding, steamed cake mixtures such as
treacle sponge pudding with or without the addition of ingredients such as
dried fruits as in a Christmas pudding. Savory dishes include Yorkshire
pudding, black pudding, suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding.
